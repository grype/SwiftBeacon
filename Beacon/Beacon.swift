/**
 I am the central object around signaling.
 
 I maintain a collection of loggers and provide a method for signaling them.
 Before I can be used in a meaningful way, add and start instances of SignalLogger, like this:
 
 ````
 let logger = ConsoleLogger(name: 'My console logger')
 logger.start()
 Beacon.shared.loggers.append(logger)
 
 // or in shorter form:
 Beacon.shared.add(ConsoleLogger(name: 'My console logger', start: true))
 ````
 
 After that, I will announce all signals sent via `signal(_:)` to each logger.
 
 ````
 Beacon.shared.signal(WrapperSignal("This is only a string"))
 ````
 
 It is up to individual loggers to decide whether and how to handle each signal.
 
 These are the basic methods of operation, albeit a bit tedious. A simpler approach
 would be to use `emit()`. Instances of `Signal` understand `emit()`, and there
 are several global emit() functions defined by specific signals...
 
 ````
 emit()     // Emits current context signal
 emit(aSignalingObject)   // Emits a signal associated with an object that conforms to Signaling
 emit(error: anError)   // Emits an error signal
 ````
 
 - Note: *I maintain a shared instance, as one instance is generally sufficient.
 If you require multiple beacon objects, be sure to include the appropriate object
 when calling emit:*
 
 ````
 emit(something, on: myBeaconObject)
 ````
