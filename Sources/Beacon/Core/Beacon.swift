/**
 I am the central object around signaling and provide an interface for notifying subscribed loggers with signals.
 
 I utilize `Announcer` to post notification about the signals I receive. Subscribed loggers decide whether and how to handle a signal.
 
 ````
 let beacon = Beacon()
 let logger = ConsoleLogger(named: "My Console Logger")
 logger.start(on: [beacon])
 
 emit(on: [beacon])     // Emits current context signal
 emit(aSignalingObject, on: [beacon])   // Emits a signal associated with an object that conforms to Signaling
 emit(error: anError, on: [beacon])   // Emits an error signal
 
 logger.stop(on: [beacon])
 ````
 
 I also provide a shared general-purpose instance, as a single instance is sufficient in most cases.
 Omitting a beacon when starting a logger or emitting a signal implies this shared instance. Along with a shorthand for logging, the above can be rewritten as:
 
 ````
 let logger = ConsoleLogger(named: "My Console Logger")
 logger.run {
    emit()
    emit(aSignalingObject)
    emit(error: anError)
 }
 ````
